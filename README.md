### Programming Exercices

Different exercices for each lenguaje that I'm trying to learn.

#### Run CS or CSX single file
Install [dotnet-script](https://github.com/filipw/dotnet-script) running the command below (assuming you have [dotnet](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download) already)
```bash
dotnet tool install -g dotnet-script
```
Open the terminal in the same folder of this files and run the next command to see the result of this exercices
```bash
dotnet script fileName.cs # Need specify the file extension
```
